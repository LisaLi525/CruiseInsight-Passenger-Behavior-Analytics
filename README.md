# CruiseInsight: Passenger Behavior Analytics

## Overview
CruiseInsight is a comprehensive data analytics initiative designed to delve into the intricacies of web-based cruise bookings. Our primary objective is to extract meaningful insights about passenger behavior, preferences, and booking patterns through the application of advanced statistical and machine learning methodologies.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: In-depth cleansing and preparation of transactional data, making it suitable for analytical endeavors.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed visualization of passenger data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employment of Logistic Regression to accurately forecast passenger behavior and preferences.
- **Feature Importance**: Identification and analysis of key factors that significantly influence passenger decisions.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CruiseInsight.git
   ```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels
```

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean your dataset, performing all necessary preprocessing steps.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Use various plotting functions to explore and visualize different aspects of the data.
- **Model Building**: Develop and train the Logistic Regression model to predict passenger behavior.
- **Evaluation**: Measure model performance with metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
